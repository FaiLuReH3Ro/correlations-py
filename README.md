## 📈 Dataset Used

I will use various tables in the database (`survey-data.db`) that were created during the [Outliers](https://github.com/FaiLuReH3Ro/outliers-py) section.

### Tables

* __main__ - Main unedited table
* __noOutCompT__ - Table with no outliers in `CompTotal` column
* __noOutCompY__ - Table with no outliers in `ConvertedCompYearly` column

The tables are derived from [`clean_survey_data.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/failureh3ro/stack-overflow-survey-2024-cleaned-data).

## 🚀 Objectives

* Connect to the database using SQLite
* Find some correlations and trends in the data
* Visualize the correlations and trends

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* Jupyter notebook
* Python
* SQL
* SQLite
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Numpy

## 📊 Visualizations Used

* Heat Map
* Scatter Plot
* Line Plot
