# Finding Correlations - Python

<p>This is part of the <a href = 'https://github.com/FaiLuReH3Ro/IBM-DataAnalyst-Capstone'>IBM Data Analyst Capstone - Python</a> project and part of the <a href = 'https://github.com/FaiLuReH3Ro/IBM-DA-Capstone-Py?tab=readme-ov-file#exploratory-data'>Exploritory Data Analysis</a> section.</p>

## Dataset Used

I will use various tables in the database (`survey-data.db`) that were created during the [Outliers](https://github.com/FaiLuReH3Ro/Outliers-Py) section.

### Tables

* __main__ - Main unedited table
* __noOutCompT__ - Table with no outliers in `CompTotal` column
* __noOutCompY__ - Table with no outliers in `ConvertedCompYearly` column

The tables are derived from `clean_survey_data.csv`.

## Objectives

* Connect to the database using sqlite3
* Find some correlations and trends in the data
* Visualize the correlations and trends

## Tools Used

* Jupyter notebook
* Python
* SQL
* SQLite3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Numpy
