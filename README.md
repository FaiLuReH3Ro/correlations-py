[Finding Correlations - Python](https://github.com/FaiLuReH3Ro/correlations-py/blob/main/Finding_Correlations.ipynb)

## Dataset Used

I will use various tables in the database (`survey-data.db`) that were created during the [Outliers](https://github.com/FaiLuReH3Ro/outliers-py) section.

### Tables

* __main__ - Main unedited table
* __noOutCompT__ - Table with no outliers in `CompTotal` column
* __noOutCompY__ - Table with no outliers in `ConvertedCompYearly` column

The tables are derived from `clean_survey_data.csv`.

## Objectives

* Connect to the database using sqlite3
* Find some correlations and trends in the data
* Visualize the correlations and trends

## Tools Used

* Jupyter notebook
* Python
* SQL
* SQLite3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Numpy
